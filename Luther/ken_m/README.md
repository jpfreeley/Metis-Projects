Condensed files from Project 2 (Luther)

I made the mistake of deleting the most up to date IMDBRatingScraper.py file and am unable to recover it (deleted it in Jupyter). Unfortunately this breaks a lot of the code that tries to import it. If I have time I may try to rewrite the code for that file.
