# Solving KenKen Puzzles with Computer Vision

### What is this?

This was my final project at Metis. I wanted to do something with with computer vision and/or deep learning but I also wanted to do something that would be reasonably attainable.

I was browsing project suggestions on [various college websites](https://sites.google.com/a/eng.ucsd.edu/cse-155-spring-2012/home/projects/suggested-research-projects) and one of the ideas I saw was to solve Sudoku puzzles with computer vision. It linked to a [blog post](http://sudokugrab.blogspot.com/2009/07/how-does-it-all-work.html) someone had made outlining the idea. I wanted to do this but it also something new since this seemed to be relatively easy.

I decided to go with KenKen puzzles (the reason definitely wasn't because I share my name with it). I had previously seen a Reddit post that was about algorithms for solving KenKen puzzles so all I had to focus on was the CV side of things.

You can find the final product here or at my blog, where you can also read more about this project.
